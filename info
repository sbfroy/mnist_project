## What is a Tensor?

Tensors are the basic data structures that contain mostly numerical data. They are containers for numbers and a
generalization of matrices to an arbitrary number of dimensions.


## What is a data loader?

Data loaders are crucial for efficient feeding of data into a neural network. They simplify the process by batching
the data, shuffling it at the beginning of each epoch and allowing for parallel processing. This optimizes the training
process, improves efficiency and generalizes the model.


## Skeletonization?

Skeletonization is the process of reducing the thickness of an object. Finding the essentials.
